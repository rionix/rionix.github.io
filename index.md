### ðŸ“¦ ShapesVisualizer

Plugin for Unreal Engine. Includes component that can draw different shapes: spheres, half spheres, boxes, cylinders, cones, capsules, points and polyline in wireframe and solid mode. It is very convenient for displaying debugging information: target search areas, viewing angles, points of interest and others. You just add the component to the actor, select the shape, set its size, visibility settings and that's it.

### ðŸ“¦ GameplayTags Component

Plugin for Unreal Engine. Includes component that contains Gameplay Tags. Add it to your Actors in which you want to use Gameplay Tags. You can then use the universal functions to manage (adding or removing) Gameplay Tags in Actors or check (one or more) those Tags. Those functions don't care whether the Actors have this Component or not, they work similarly to events for Interfaces.
